# Using the plugin

## Create an instance with pgBackRest

The `examples` directory contains several pre-configured manifests
designed to work with [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
(Eg: the pull policy is set to `Never`). 
These files may require modifications to run on other types of
Kubernetes clusters.

To use this plugin with a `Cluster`, CloudNativePG users must :

1. Create a secret named `pgbackrest-s3-secret` in the namespace of the
  PostgreSQL `Cluster`. This secret must contain the `key` and
  `secret-key` of the `s3` bucket.

  Example:

  ```yaml title="secret.yaml"
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: pgbackrest-s3-secret
  type: Opaque
  stringData:
    ACCESS_KEY_ID: <key_to_replace>
    ACCESS_SECRET_KEY: <secret_to_replace>
  ```

2. Create a pgBackRest `stanza` :

  Example:

  ```yaml title="stanza.yaml"
  ---
  apiVersion: pgbackrest.dalibo.com/v1
  kind: Stanza
  metadata:
    name: stanza-sample
  spec:
    stanzaConfiguration:
      name: main
      s3Repositories:
        - bucket: demo
          endpoint: s3.minio.svc.cluster.local
          region: us-east-1
          repoPath: /cluster-demo
          uriStyle: path
          verifyTLS: false
          retentionPolicy:
            full: 7
            fullType: count
            diff: 14
            archive: 2
            archiveType: full
            history: 30
          secretRef:
            accessKeyId:
              name: pgbackrest-s3-secret
              key: ACCESS_KEY_ID
            secretAccessKey:
              name: pgbackrest-s3-secret
              key: ACCESS_SECRET_KEY
  ```

:::note
The `s3Repositories` variable is a list. You can
configure multiple repositories. You can then select the repository to
which your backup will be performed. By default :
* the first repository is selected for backup ;
* WAL archiving always occurs on all repositories.
:::

3. Create the PostgreSQL `Cluster` and adapt the manifest by :
  * adding the plugin definition `pgbackrest.dalibo.com` under the
    `plugins` entry;
  * referencing the pgBackRest `stanza` resource with `stanzaRef`.

Example:

```yaml title="cluster.yaml"
---
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-demo
spec:
  instances: 1
  plugins:
    - name: pgbackrest.dalibo.com
      isWALArchiver: true
      parameters:
        stanzaRef: stanza-sample
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
```

If it runs without errors, the `Pod` dedicated to the PostgreSQL `Cluster`
should have now two containers. One for the `postgres` service (which is
the default setup), an other one for the pgbackrest plugin, named
`pgbackrest-plugin`. The injected container now holds the responsibility
for archiving the WALs and triggering backups when a backup request is
made.

## Stanza Initialization

Stanzas are initialized when archiving the first WAL. Since the stanza
initialization state is tracked internally, restarting the sidecar
container will require running the `pgbackrest create-stanza` command
again.

## WAL Archiving

WAL archiving can be customized through the `pgbackrest` CRD. It is
possible to define the WAL archiving strategy (e.g. [using the
`asynchronous`
mode](https://pgbackrest.org/configuration.html#section-archive/option-archive-async))
as well as configure the `pgbackrest` queue size.
